### Features: 
    1. Content tree
    2. Creates nesting extracts and flashcards
    3. Editable topics, extracts and flashcard questions
    4. Grading and review of cards

### TODOs: 
    - [ ] Need to fix LLM API integration in script.js --> doesn't generate intelligent flashcards.
    - [ ] Remove previous button, the next button just goes through the learning queue
    - [ ] Show message that all cards are done at the end.
    - [ ] Add icons to content tree
    - [ ] The parent text must be highlighted once extract is done
    - [ ] Implement cloze
    - [ ] Implement automated extracts and flashcards (only if high quality questions and extracts can be generated by AI)
